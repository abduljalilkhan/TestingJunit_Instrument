# Project Title - Testing Classes

## Overview

This repository contains testing classes showcasing my skills in Android app testing. The code provided includes examples of unit tests, Espresso UI tests, and UI Automator tests. Due to the confidential nature of my previous work, the full project cannot be shared. However, this repository serves as a sample of my coding style and testing practices.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this repository is to allow potential employers and collaborators to evaluate my code quality and testing methodologies. The included code demonstrates my proficiency in:

- **JUnit**: Implementing unit tests for robust application logic.
- **Espresso**: Conducting UI tests to ensure a seamless user experience.
